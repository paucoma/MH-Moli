Who: Pau
When: Saturday
Why: Routine Inspection
What: Download Data, Visual inspection
Where: At the "Escala de peixos"

Found: Everything in order except for that someone had moved the Flume Covers blocking the ultrasound measurement path. As a consequence the sensor was measuring 500mm which is out of bounds and therefore the recorded result was 0.

Analyzing the logs: it appears as though there are some spikes every now and then.. a bit strange.. will need to generate correlation graphs to see where and when it may be coming from.
