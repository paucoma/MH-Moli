TeamViewer with Gonzalo

When: Thursday
Why: To learn how to add some dummy variables

The reason why the variable starts at 17 is because the Topkapi has digital variables defined from 1 to 16 and then analogic varibles.

  1. Parametrizacion --> Recursos --> AÃ±adir un recurso --> Variable --> Variable logica
  2. Add in the resource defines : Funciones --> Historico --> Historico digital
  3. Click on the new defined Historic: 
    - Set a title
    - Set the Id to the specific WIT-Trace that we want.
  4. We can repeat this in theory for as many as we want in the same box.
