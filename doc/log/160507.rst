- Working on MH-Moli
--------------
WIT Equipment 
--------------

  - Did a calculation on the consumed energy by the device and it turns out that the consumption average is around 2.5W, seems a bit low.. maybe there was a reset? 
    + In any case, going to add a battery to the Device on its battery terminal.
    
  1. Turned off the power
  2. Connected the 12V Battery
    2a. The WIT turned on, the Bat light on the Plugpower is constant on, current consumption from the bat was approx 250mA
  3. Connected the Power again.
    3a. The Bat light started blinking rapidly.. the current into the bat(I'm assuming was 130 mA and decreasing)
  4. Reconnected to the WIT, the Historicos are blanked out, except for the VA which is at 1197.731 litres


WIT Program
============

  - Noticed that the Accumulated Volume does not update, this is because the little checkbox for clear was ticked.
    + I unticked it to resolve the problem. Now the Volume is accumulating.. Saved the new Parameters.
  - Not so sure about the current measurement... going to test with he multimeter in series
    + Adjusted to 1,0573 multiplying factor
